# BBC Barlesque sample pages

The two templates within this repository are sample pages to demonstrate to
developers on bbc.co.uk how to use the Barlesque page templating system using
server side includes (`mod_include` in Apache).

One of these days, I'll get around to converting the little-known documentation
to Markdown, but it's available on [bbc.co.uk/includes/blq](bbc.co.uk/includes/blq/)
for now.
